   cd meproofit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## LLM Configuration

### OpenAI GPT-4 (Recommended)

The app is configured to use OpenAI's GPT-4 API for generating sentences with errors. This provides:

- **High-quality content**: Age-appropriate, engaging sentences
- **Consistent error patterns**: Mix of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization errors
- **Topic relevance**: Contextually relevant content for each topic
- **Cost-effective**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens

### Alternative LLM Options

If you prefer different LLM providers:

1. **Anthropic Claude**
   - Very good at educational content
   - Slightly more expensive but reliable
   - Update `llmService.ts` to use Claude API

2. **Google Gemini**
   - Lower cost per token
   - Good performance for text generation
   - Update `llmService.ts` to use Gemini API

3. **Local Models** (for privacy)
   - Consider using Ollama or similar local LLM solutions
   - Update `llmService.ts` to use local API endpoints

### Fallback System

The app includes a robust fallback system with predefined sentences for each topic, ensuring the game works even without API access.

## Mobile App Development

The React codebase is designed to be easily portable to mobile platforms:

### React Native
- Most components can be adapted with minimal changes
- Use React Native equivalents for web-specific libraries
- Replace Tailwind CSS with React Native styling

### Expo
- Excellent for rapid mobile development
- Can reuse most of the existing logic
- Built-in deployment to App Store and Google Play

### Flutter (Alternative)
- Rewrite the UI in Flutter
- Reuse the LLM service logic
- Better performance for complex animations
